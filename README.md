# Simple Home Automation using Arduino

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple home automation system using an Arduino board.  
You can control two LEDs (acting as lights) through the Serial Monitor by typing simple text commands — no breadboard or button is required.

## Components
- Arduino UNO (or compatible board)  
- 2 LEDs  
- 2 Resistors (220Ω each)  
- Jumper wires  

## Circuit Connections
| Component | Arduino Pin | Description |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| LED1 | D8 | Long leg (Anode) → D8, Short leg → GND (via 220Ω resistor) |
| LED2 | D9 | Long leg (Anode) → D9, Short leg → GND (via 220Ω resistor) |
